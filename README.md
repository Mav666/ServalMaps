# Serval Maps #

The Serval Maps application started as a prototype application developed as part of techxplorer's [honours thesis](http://bytechxplorer.com/studies/honours-thesis/).

The purpose of the application is to provide a collaborative mapping application which is infrastructure independent. It uses the resilient AdHoc mesh network provided by the [Serval Project](http://www.servalproject.org/) to transfer information between instances of the application. 

Map data is sourced from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and managed using the [mapsforge](http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/) library. 

As development progresses more information will be made available on the [Thoughts by Techxplorer blog](http://techxplorer.com) and on the [Serval Project Wiki](http://developer.servalproject.org/dokuwiki/doku.php).

## Version 0.2 ##

This is the development branch for version 0.2 of the application. This version will take advantage of the MeshMS functionality provided by the main Serval Project application. 

It was decided that a complete rewrite, using the lessons learned from the development of the prototype version, was easier than retrofitting the existing prototype.
